Hi.

I am Victor Shepelev (aka "zverok"), Ruby programmer and also poet.
I live in Kharkiv, Ukraine* and work for [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/) (previously, [BrandSpotter](http://brandspotter.ru)).

<small>* If, by chance, you care about actual politics, I am pro-[Euromaidan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euromaidan) and pro-Ukrainian, despite what you may have been told about citizens of Eastern Ukraine. In fact, most of us kharkivites are.</small>

Recently I've released some useful Ruby gems (and plan to do much more):

* [reality](https://github.com/molybdenum-99/reality) -- Easy access to all world knowledge as a computable entities (via Wikipedia, Wikidata and other open datasources);
* [infoboxer](https://github.com/molybdenum-99/infoboxer) -- Wikipedia client and parser, targeting data extraction;
* [worldize](https://github.com/zverok/worldize) -- simple coloured countries stats drawing with RMagick;
* [wheretz](https://github.com/zverok/wheretz) -- fast and precise time zone by geo coordinates lookup;
* [time_math2](http://github.com/zverok/time_math2) -- library for handling simple time arithmetics, like "round time to the day edge" or "add two months to current date" or "generate hour-by-hour sequence".
* [magic_cloud](http://github.com/zverok/magic_cloud) -- pretty Wordle-like wordcloud in pure Ruby;
* [procme](http://github.com/zverok/procme) -- experimental Ruby syntax extension for DRYer array filtering and processing;
* [dokaz](http://github.com/zverok/dokaz) -- test code from inside of your Markdown documentation files;
* [linkhum](https://github.com/zverok/linkhum) -- "links-in-text humanizer", linkify text-only input.

And, not a gems, but also worth mentioning:

* [rubyseeds](https://github.com/zverok/rubyseeds) -- public repository of useful core_exts;
* [xkcdize](https://github.com/zverok/xkcdize) and [drosterize](https://github.com/zverok/drosterize) -- experiments on converting some "cool" image-processing tricks from Wolfram Language (Mathematica) to Ruby + RMagick;
* [matchish](https://github.com/zverok/matchish) -- experiment in doing pattern-matching "the Ruby way".

## Short list of programming and related skills

* Writing (mostly) in Ruby, 10 years of commercial Ruby programming; only non-Rails experience (very basic knowledge of Rails ecosystem);
* Fairly good (though outdated) knowledge of PHP, and fairly strong disgust;
* A long time ago I was a C++ expert, in love with template metaprogramming and stuff;
* To a certain amount, also know (= have been writing production code): Pascal (Delphi), Python, JavaScript, VBA;
* Can read code in almost any popular language, including exotic ones, can learn a new programming language to "reading and understanding" level very fast (and glad to do so);
* Very good at R&D tasks, prototyping, architecture, data extraction, legacy code understanding and refactoring, representation of complex data;
* Generally prefer writing compact solutions for complex problems over large and cool solutions for simple problems

* Ruby framework of choice - Sinatra (and Grape occasionally);
* SQL database - MySQL (no experience with any other), no fear of database design, normalization and denormalization (and making decisions between them), though, far from DBA level;
* Have some (not very complicated) experience with NoSQL databases, mostly Mongo, some Redis, accidentally Cassandra;
* Have done a lot of things with AMQP (RabbitMQ);
* Some experience (including practical) with Semantic Web technologies: RDF, SPARQL, Virtuoso;
* Very outdated experience with neural networks;

* Solid knowledge in basic client-side technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, XML/XSL/xPath), regular understanding of HTTP protocol and so on;
* Able to make good decisions about user interface logic and information architecture, but have no solid education and no graphic prototyping skills at all;

* Master degree in Computer Science;
* Variable level of English: excellent reading, strange yet understandable writing (as you can see), really bad spoken one.
